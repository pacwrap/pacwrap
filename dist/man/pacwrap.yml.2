NAME\fR
.TP
\fBpacwrap.yml\fR - pacwrap configuration file.
.TP
\fBrepositories.conf\fR - pacman repository file.

.SH
SYNOPSIS\fR
.TP
\fB~/.config/pacwrap/pacwrap.yml\fR
.TP
\fB~/.config/pacwrap/repositories.conf\fR

.SH
DESCRIPTION\fR
Pacwrap upon invocation will attempt to deserialise \fBpacwrap.yml\fR(2) at the location specified herein
compliant with the XDG Directory Specification. Upon activation of \fBlibalpm\fR(3), the repositories.conf
file will be deserialised by the pacman_conf crate in order to faciliate the population of package
repositories and mirrors.

.PP
Repository configuration is parsed using \fBpacman.conf\fR(5)'s ini format. All other options related the
\fBlibalpm\fR(3) as defined by \fBpacman.conf\fR(5) therein are otherwise ignored. At present by default, 
the repository configuration, as defined, references the mirrorlist defined by your system. 
This ensures as smooth of an out-of-box experience as humanly possible.

Optionally you may specify environment variables, as specified in \fBpacwrap\fR(1), to override
these locations. These options are designated for experienced users only.
